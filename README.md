# CS034-13.8-Project-3-Implementation-Phase-Instructions

# Overview
This project applies graphs and search algorithms to solve a real-world delivery route planning problem. We hope to optimize the route by finding the quickest and most efficient route. Users can enter a depot and any delivery stops along the way of a route. The program then checks if the route exists. If it does, it will then compute the most efficient path using Dijkstra's algorithm. This program reads graph data from a .csv file.
